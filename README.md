# twitch-clip-to-yt
Scrape twitch clips (don't do that unless its ur own) and then auto upload to yt


Has a cool UI which allows you to customize the title of the clip and then press upload and u can scroll through the clips, shows u a thumbnail preview that u can click on in order to watch the clip and then upload to yt using OAUTH


Read through the code and replace the api keys in the code in order for it to work, made it poorly cuz i was lazy and dumb when i made, but you can message me to improve it or u need help configuring it for your own.

Watching tutorials on yt api might help you.

you can always fork it too but its not an impressive project and its written poorly so...
